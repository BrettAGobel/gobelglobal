    <h1>Purpose, Audience, & Goal</h1>
    <hr>
        <p><b><u>Purpose:</u></b>  The goal of my PWP is to learn and implement basic design concepts to create a professional
      looking and functional homepage for a fictitious industrial company.</p>
        <p><b><u>Audience:</u></b>  This site will be built for a professional audience from a variety of industries:  Electronics, Aviation, Recycling, Renewable Energy etc.
    This audience will be seeking to add competent individuals to their web and marketing team to update and produce content for their
    site.  Target audience: hiring managers, marketing managers, development leads.</p>
        <p><b><u>Goal:</u></b>  The main goal of this site is to use all the techniques and standards I will learn in the bootcamp to demonstrate
    competence, professionalism and insight to potential future employers.  The secondary goal is to solidify all basics of front-end development
    taught to me throughout the bootcamp to produce a simple, aesthetic and functional site.</p>

    <h2>Persona</h2>
        <p><b><u>Name:</u></b>  Jeremy Albright</p>
        <p><b><u>Age:</u></b>  42</p>

        <p><b><u>Profession:</u></b>  Mr. Albright is the head of a currently low-scale marketing department for a mid-level industrial sales company,
        seeking to hire individuals who can contribute to a team dedicated to polishing and maintaining their web-presence.
        Their website is already functional, but the team is still small and as sales are projected to be on the rise in coming
        years, new team members are expected to be needed in order to keep databases, new product information and appearance clean and up-to-date.</p>


        <p><b><u>Technology:</u></b>  Mr. Albright is a Windows user through and through.  He has spent time using Adobe
        applications to produce content for both print and web.  In the past he has been allotted a Blackberry as a company device, but personally
        prefers his tried and true Samsung Galaxy S10.  Working in marketing, he is accustomed to solving various issues relating to color,
        image sizes, file types etc. and is used to researching various mediums to ensure his product will be displayed correctly.</p>

        <p><b><u>Frustrations & Needs:</u></b>  Mr. Albright is seasoned in last minute mishaps and does not succumb to frustration as easily as many.
        However, he does expect a deadline to met and if frustration is to occur it's when adequate work isn't being done to ensure this happens.
        He prefers communication if problems arise so he is at least aware of them and expects to not be hit with last minute issues he couldn't
        have foreseen given appropriate communication.  He needs organization and adherence to standards he has set in place.  He is ok with discussion
        about the standards but wants it to be understood that what he says goes in the end.</p>

        <p><b><u>Goals:</u></b>  Mr. Albright is concerned with conveying the right message to the customers and keeping
        the company image consistent.  He knows that producing a company image relies just as much on marketing strategies
        as website functionality and appearance.  His goals are to find individuals who have the skills to maintain and update
        the company website such that appearance and feeling are totally in line.  When he accesses a site a candidate has made
        he expects to see his own values echoed through the sites appearance and functionality.</p>

    <h3>User Story</h3>

    <p>As a user, I need to ascertain whether this candidate has the skills to understand and implement web-design and how
    this coincides with the company image</p>
