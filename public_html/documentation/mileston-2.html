<p>Navbar: Navbar will be atypical, with links left aligned following my fake compnay logo.  Trying for right aligned dropdown for login and hopfully a dropdown to select languages</p>
<p>Middle section:  Has 2 parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Our Industries: 4 pictures with on hover opacity effect with and a button to "learn more"</li>
        <li>News/tweets: News tweets section will obviously not take a real feed but I will mock it up with fake content in the form
        of a long JPG with overflow to simulate a scrolling wall</li>
    </ul>
<p>Our Mission: Right aligned photo or Hero style bkg image with mission statement</p>
<p>Products/Services/Tech:  3 Images, maybe cards or just symbols that would simulate links to those sections</p>
<p>Footer:  Footer contains fake contact information and Logo</p>
<p>Contact me:  Ideally this contact me form is selected from the top Nav Bar and produces an overlay for someone to fill out</p>

<hr>
<p>Navbar: Atypical mobile nav with dropdown and hamburger menu</p>
<p>Middle Section: Consists of column level industry information from Browser view<p>
<p>Our Mission:  No change except for location of text and Image</p>
<p>Products/Services/Tech: is now without photos and exists as simple list</p>
<p>Footer: Virtually same as browser footer but hopefully with centerd logo</p>
